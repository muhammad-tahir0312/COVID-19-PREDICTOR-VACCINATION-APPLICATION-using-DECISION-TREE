# COVID-19 PREDICTOR (using DECISION TREE) & VACCINATION CONSOLE BASED APPLICATION 

## Project Overview

In response to the ongoing global pandemic, we have developed a COVID Vaccination Center Management System, an application designed to provide citizens with easy access to information regarding vaccination centers, appointments, and vaccine inventory. The primary goal is to streamline the vaccination process, ensuring that citizens are well-informed and receive timely vaccinations.

## Features

1. **User Sign Up/Login:**
   - Users are required to sign up to access the platform, ensuring a secure and personalized experience.

2. **Menu Display:**
   - A user-friendly menu interface that allows users to navigate through the application seamlessly.

3. **Inventory Management:**
   - Efficient tracking and management of vaccine inventory to ensure an adequate supply at all vaccination centers and hospitals.

4. **Citizen Information Storage:**
   - Secure storage of citizen information to facilitate appointment scheduling and management.

5. **Appointment Scheduling:**
   - Unvaccinated citizens can schedule appointments for their convenience, and the system assigns them a vaccination center near their residence.

6. **Vaccine Variety Options:**
   - Users have the option to choose from a variety of vaccines based on availability and preferences.

7. **Automobile Service for Localities:**
   - Localities with a certain number of appointments will be provided with an automobile service, enhancing accessibility to vaccination centers.

8. **COVID Predictor:**
   - Utilizes a decision tree algorithm to provide users with predictions based on their symptoms, offering additional health-related insights.

9. **Overall Area Statistics:**
   - Generates and displays overall statistics based on geographic areas, aiding in resource allocation and planning.

## Basic Formalities

The project covers essential functionalities such as sign-up/login, menu display, inventory management, citizen information storage, appointment scheduling, vaccine variety options, automobile service for localities, COVID predictor, and overall area statistics.

## Techniques Used

The implementation of the system incorporates various programming techniques:
- Abstraction
- Classes and Objects
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism (Overloading and Overriding)
- Conditional and Looping Structures
- Data Structures (Arrays, Array of Objects, etc.)
- Constructors and Destructors
- File Handling and Data Storage Systems
- Exception Handling

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed (if any).
3. Run the main application file to launch the system.
